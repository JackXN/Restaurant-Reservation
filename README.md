### Overview

**Periodic Tables** is designed to help restaurants manage reservations and tables and keep track of customer data on an easy-to-use platform. Users can create and edit reservations, create tables, assign reservations to tables, and search for reservations by a customer's phone number. This basic functionality alleviates a restaurant's need to keep paper documentation of reservations and table availability, by automating these processes. This ensures better management of reservations and keeps a digital record of all information so nothing is lost or forgotten.

Upon submitting, the user will return to the previous page to see the dashboard has been updated, showing the reservation with status "seated" and the selected table with status "occupied". The table will also now have a "Finish" button on it.
